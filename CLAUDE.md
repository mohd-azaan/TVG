# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## IMPORTANT

1. Always Prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code.
2. Use simple & easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.
3. DO NOT BE LAZY! Always read files IN FULL!!
4. Don't Update the services or endpoints which are already confirmed and working! But your written if just optimizing then it's fine
5. When Working with features please create a feature/\*\* branch and then implement it in that branch and ask for MERGE!, if Okay then merge it in 'develop' branch
6. Before generating anything from scratch, check if exists and try to reuse properly
7. for now no need of responsive just focus on Desktop view

## COMMENTS

1. Write Comments in your code. Explain Exactly what you are doing in you comments.W

## PLAN MODE RULES

<restrictions>
## RESTRICTIONS
Do What has be asked; nothing more, nothing less

## PLAN MODE RULES

1. Never propose a plan of action, UNLESS the user tells you to explicitly
2. IF you are in 'plan mode', it means the User wants to TALK and PLAN with you, not do any code
3. DO NOT propose code changes while you are in 'plan mode'
4. When in 'plan mode', just respond to the user. That's it
   </restrictions>

## Header Comments

- EVERY file has to start with 4 lines of comments!
  1. Exact file Location in codebase
  2. clear description of what this file does
  3. clear description of why this file exists
  4. RELVANT FILES: comma-seperated list of 2-4 most relevant files
- NEVER delete these "header comments" from the files you're editing.

## Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. DO NOT BE LAZY. NEVER BE LAZY. IF THERE IS A BUG FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IT. NO TEMPORARY FIXES. YOU ARE A SENIOR DEVELOPER. NEVER BE LAZY
9. MAKE ALL FIXES AND CODE CHANGES AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THEY SHOULD ONLY IMPACT NECESSARY CODE RELEVANT TO THE TASK AND NOTHING ELSE. IT SHOULD IMPACT AS LITTLE CODE AS POSSIBLE. YOUR GOAL IS TO NOT INTRODUCE ANY BUGS. IT'S ALL ABOUT SIMPLICITY

## Development Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server at http://localhost:5173/
- `npm run build` - Build for production

## Project Architecture

This is a React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It was generated by Anima using the Shadcn UI library.

### Tech Stack

- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.0.4
- **Framework**: React 18.2.0 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.16 with custom TVG design system
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI (Radix UI primitives)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 6.8.1
- **Utilities**: clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority

### Directory Structure

- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component with React Router setup
- `src/screens/HomepageDesktop/` - Main homepage screen with sections
- `src/components/ui/` - Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Navigation Menu)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions (cn function for className merging)

### Key Design Patterns

- **Component Organization**: Screen-based architecture with sections
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with Tailwind classes and custom TVG typography system
- **State Management**: Local React state (useState hooks)
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI pattern with variant-based styling

### Custom Configuration

- **Tailwind Config**: Extended with TVG-specific typography fonts and design tokens
- **Alias**: `@/*` maps to `./src/components/ui/$1`
- **TypeScript**: Configured with separate app and node configs
- **Vite**: PostCSS integration for Tailwind processing

### Homepage Structure

The main homepage (`HomepageDesktop`) includes these sections:

- HeaderSection, HeroSection, ServicesSection, StatisticsSection
- PlayYourWaySection, HowItWorksSection, MeetGolfzonSection
- TestimonialsSection, FooterSection
- Fixed membership promo card with dismissible functionality

### Styling Guidelines

- Uses TVG custom typography system with CSS variables
- Shadcn UI color scheme with HSL CSS variables
- Component styling with className composition using `cn()` utility
- Responsive design with Tailwind breakpoint classes

## Mobile Responsiveness Best Practices

### Hero Section Mobile Optimizations (Implemented)

**Container & Layout**:
- Use responsive padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-10` instead of fixed `px-10`
- Remove left margins on mobile: `lg:ml-[15vw] md:ml-[10vw]` (no `sm:ml-[5vw]`)
- Content aligns to left edge on mobile with proper padding

**Typography Scaling**:
- Welcome text: `text-[32px] sm:text-[42px] lg:text-[55px]` with `leading-[1.1]`
- Main headline: `text-[clamp(110px,12vw,160px)]` - maintains readability with 110px minimum
- Description text: Responsive max-width `lg:max-w-[535px] md:max-w-[500px] sm:max-w-[400px]`

**Key Principles**:
- Avoid aggressive font scaling that makes text unreadable on mobile
- Use progressive enhancement: mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens
- Maintain text hierarchy and readability across all device sizes
- Remove excessive margins/padding that waste mobile screen real estate
