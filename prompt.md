I need you to perform a comprehensive SEO and performance optimization audit on my React.js static website located at https://www.thevirtualgreens.com

CONTEXT AND CONSTRAINTS:
- This is a production website that must remain visually unchanged
- NO styling modifications, NO component additions/removals, NO user-facing changes
- Focus exclusively on technical optimizations that improve SEO visibility and performance
- The attached strategy guide contains specific React.js optimization patterns for 2025

PHASE 1 - DEEP ANALYSIS AND INVENTORY [CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP]:

First, create a detailed audit file called "OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT.md" that documents:

1. Codebase Structure Analysis:
   - Map out all React components and their hierarchy
   - Identify the routing structure (React Router, Next.js, or other)
   - Document the current build tool (Webpack, Vite, CRA, Next.js)
   - List all image assets and their formats
   - Note the current bundle size and code splitting strategy

2. SEO Current State:
   - Check for React Helmet or alternative SEO library usage
   - Document existing meta tags on each route/page
   - Identify any structured data implementations
   - Check for canonical URLs and sitemap.xml
   - Review robots.txt configuration

3. Performance Baseline:
   - Identify lazy loading implementations
   - Check for code splitting at route and component levels
   - Document current image optimization strategies
   - Note any existing performance optimizations
   - Check for React.memo, useMemo, useCallback usage patterns

4. Technical Debt Assessment:
   - Identify components causing unnecessary re-renders
   - Find large bundle dependencies
   - Detect missing accessibility attributes
   - Note any console errors or warnings

IMPORTANT: After completing each section, add a comment like "// AUDIT: Found X issues in category Y" to maintain context awareness.

PHASE 2 - STRATEGIC PLANNING:

Create "IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md" with prioritized tasks based on impact:

Priority 1 - Critical SEO Fixes (Immediate impact):
- Meta tag implementation gaps
- Missing structured data
- URL structure issues
- Sitemap/robots.txt problems

Priority 2 - Core Web Vitals (1-2 week impact):
- LCP optimizations needed
- INP (Interaction to Next Paint) improvements
- CLS prevention measures

Priority 3 - Performance Enhancements:
- Code splitting opportunities
- Image optimization requirements
- Bundle size reductions

For each item, specify:
- Current state vs. desired state
- Implementation approach from the strategy guide
- Expected impact on metrics
- Files that need modification

PHASE 3 - SYSTEMATIC IMPLEMENTATION:

Execute optimizations in this specific order:

Step 1 - SEO Foundation:
a) If using React Helmet, migrate to React Helmet Async:
   - Update package.json dependencies
   - Wrap App with HelmetProvider
   - Update all Helmet usage to async pattern
   
b) Implement comprehensive meta tags for EVERY route:
   - Title tags (50-60 characters)
   - Meta descriptions (150-160 characters)
   - Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url)
   - Twitter Card tags
   - Canonical URLs

c) Add structured data using react-schemaorg:
   - Organization schema on homepage
   - Product/Service schemas where applicable
   - BreadcrumbList for navigation
   - FAQ schemas if FAQ sections exist

Step 2 - Image Optimization:
a) Add loading="lazy" to all images below the fold
b) Add explicit width and height attributes to prevent CLS
c) Implement fetchpriority="high" for hero images
d) Add decoding="async" for non-critical images
e) Convert image filenames to SEO-friendly format (kebab-case)
f) Add comprehensive alt text focusing on keywords

Step 3 - Performance Optimizations:
a) Implement route-based code splitting:
```javascript
   const Component = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'));
```

b) Add Suspense boundaries with meaningful fallbacks:

javascript

```javascript
   <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
```

c) Optimize event handlers with debouncing/throttling d) Implement React.memo for expensive components e) Add resource hints to index.html:

* <link rel="preconnect">
* <link rel="dns-prefetch">
* <link rel="preload"> for critical resources

Step 4 - Core Web Vitals: a) Prevent layout shift:

* Add aspect-ratio CSS or explicit dimensions
* Reserve space for dynamic content

b) Optimize INP:

* Use React 18's startTransition for non-urgent updates
* Implement useDeferredValue for search inputs

c) Improve LCP:

* Preload hero images
* Optimize critical rendering path

Step 5 - Advanced Optimizations: a) Add Web Vitals monitoring:

javascript

```javascript
   import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';
```

b) Implement progressive hydration for below-fold components c) Configure build optimizations (tree shaking, minification) d) Add accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles)

PHASE 4 - VALIDATION AND TESTING:

After EACH optimization:

1. Run a build to ensure no errors
2. Visually verify no UI changes occurred
3. Add a comment in the file: "// SEO: [specific optimization applied]"
4. Update a running log file "OPTIMIZATIONS\_APPLIED.md"

Create "VALIDATION\_CHECKLIST.md" containing:

* [ ]  All routes have unique, optimized meta tags
* [ ]  Structured data validates at schema.org/validator
* [ ]  No layout shift on page load
* [ ]  Images load progressively with proper dimensions
* [ ]  Bundle size reduced by at least 20%
* [ ]  All accessibility tests pass

PHASE 5 - DOCUMENTATION AND METRICS:

Generate "OPTIMIZATION\_REPORT.md" with:

Before/After Metrics:

* Bundle sizes comparison
* Number of code-split chunks
* Image optimization savings
* Meta tag coverage percentage

Expected Improvements:

* Core Web Vitals scores
* SEO completeness score
* Accessibility score
* Performance budget adherence

Implementation Summary:

* Total files modified
* Key optimizations applied
* Potential risk areas
* Recommended next steps

EXECUTION GUIDELINES:

1. ALWAYS create backup comments before modifications:

javascript

```javascript
   // BACKUP: Original code below
   // [original code]
```

2. Use semantic commit-style comments for changes:

javascript

```javascript
   // PERF: Implemented lazy loading for ProductGrid
   // SEO: Added structured data for products
   // A11Y: Added ARIA labels for navigation
```

3. When encountering decisions, document reasoning:

javascript

```javascript
   // DECISION: Using React.lazy here because component is 50KB+
```

4. Maintain a breadcrumb trail in complex files:

javascript

```javascript
   // OPTIMIZATION PATH: Entry > Routing > LazyLoad > Complete
```

5. Test incrementally - after every 5 file modifications, summarize progress

CRITICAL REMINDERS:

* NO visual changes - preserve all existing CSS classes and inline styles
* NO component structure changes - maintain exact same JSX structure
* DO NOT modify any business logic - only optimization code
* PRESERVE all existing functionality
* MAINTAIN backward compatibility

If you encounter any of these scenarios, STOP and report:

* Deprecated dependencies that need major version updates
* Architectural changes that would require refactoring
* Visual regression risks
* Breaking changes in optimization libraries

Start by analyzing the codebase structure and create the initial audit file. Proceed methodically through each phase, maintaining context awareness with clear documentation at each step.

Refer to the attached React.js optimization strategy guide for specific implementation patterns and code examples. The guide contains 2025 best practices that should be followed exactly.

Remember: The goal is maximum SEO visibility and performance with ZERO visual changes. Every optimization should be invisible to users but significant for search engines and performance metrics.
