							For our founder—today the CEO of a publicly listed company—his
							very first encounter with the sport happened not at a boardroom,
							but on the driving range of the Royal Greens in Jeddah. After a
							high-level management meeting, he was handed a golf club for the
							first time. What seemed simple—hitting a stationary ball—turned
							into six failed swings. On the seventh, the club finally
							connected.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							A man who commands teams, strategies, and numbers at the highest
							level, suddenly found himself challenged by this deceptively
							simple game. And in that moment of frustration, a spark ignited.
							Golf had him.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							His business travels soon took him across Europe—especially
							London—where he discovered something remarkable. After work, men
							and women in suits, colleagues, and friends alike, flocked not to
							restaurants or cinemas, but to indoor golf simulators. The energy
							was infectious: laughter, competition, music, and food—all woven
							together by golf. These were not just venues; they were social
							sanctuaries. The joy he witnessed, the inclusivity, the
							togetherness—it was missing in his beloved Riyadh. And he thought:
							Why not bring this happiness home?
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							Now here's where our paths cross.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							I was fresh out of university, dreaming of NEOM and the scale of
							Vision 2030 had fueled my imagination since the day His Royal
							Highness announced it. Fate, however, led me somewhere entirely
							unexpected: into the heart of Dubai's first indoor golf concept,
							MyGolf Dubai. At first, I dismissed golf as a strange
							pursuit—hours spent chasing a little ball in the desert heat,
							usually by people whose time was too valuable to waste.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							But as I immersed myself, I learned what golf truly is:
							discipline, patience, humility, endurance, and laser-sharp focus.
							It's not just a sport—it transforms you. Golf humbles you,
							challenges you, and rewards you in ways no other game can. It is
							the only sport you can play at 5 or at 90. I often say: you are
							never the same person after golf happens to you, it changes who
							you are in the best possible way.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							Two years of pouring my soul into that project in Dubai, gave me
							perspective, grit, and the dream of bringing golf closer to what
							I've always wanted to call home—Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I wanted to
							give back to Saudi, be a part of Vision 2030—not just as a
							spectator, but as a contributor.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							In August 2024, our stories collided.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							He walked into that very venue in Dubai. By coincidence, I was the
							one who welcomed him, showed him around, and introduced him to the
							simulators. Curious about his visit, I asked his purpose. His
							answer lit a fire in me: “I want to bring this to Riyadh.” I still
							remember it like yesterday—it was a Friday, just before Jummah
							prayer. He was rushing to catch a flight, but before he left, we
							exchanged contacts. Two months later, I followed up. He hadn’t
							forgotten. The idea was alive.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							By October, the planning began. Five months later, I landed in
							Riyadh.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							The journey wasn’t easy. We studied the golf landscape here: golf
							was still tied to long drives to traditional courses, expensive
							memberships, weather extremes, and an intimidating learning curve
							for beginners. But we also saw something bigger—the Kingdom itself
							was embracing golf. The leadership was championing golf, making it
							part of the national fabric. Initiatives were underway to make it
							mainstream. The timing was right. And we had the conviction.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							And so, two people from completely different worlds—one a CEO
							humbled by his first swing, the other a young dreamer who stumbled
							into golf by chance—found common ground in one truth: golf brings
							people together.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							Today, that truth lives inside The Virtual Greens.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							A Saudi-born brand, made in Riyadh for Riyadh, built to remove
							barriers that kept people from golf and open doors. A place where
							it doesn't matter if you're a CEO or a student, a pro or a
							beginner—you belong. Where over 250+ world-class courses are at
							your fingertips. Where the swing plate shifts beneath your feet
							like real fairways. Where there's no heat, no long drives, on
							simulators trusted by pros—just pure golf, pure joy, all year
							round.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							Here, golf is not just for the elite. It's for colleagues after
							work, families on weekends, friends competing late into the night.
							It's for those chasing the thrill of the game, and those
							discovering it for the first time.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							We didn't build this to mimic London or Dubai. We built this
							because Riyadh deserves it. Because golf should no longer feel
							distant. Because happy faces in Riyadh matter as much as anywhere
							else in the world. This is more than a venue. This is our
							contribution to Vision 2030, to building community, to creating
							happiness closer to your neighborhood.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							Two lives, two paths collided, and golf brought us here. And now,
							this is for you. The Virtual Greens is more than a business. It's
							our love letter to Riyadh, to golfers, to dreamers, and to Vision
							2030.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							So step in, swing away, and be part of this story with us. Because
							golf doesn't just change your game—it changes your life.
						</p>

						<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] font-normal'>
							Now, Riyadh, it's your turn to play.
